# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application is a daily task management tool for keeping you on track during your work day. Enter your daily tasks for each hour of your day and click the save button next to your task to save the item to the list.

## Process

This project uses the bootstrap css framework for some of its styling components, font awesome for the button icon, and moment.js for date and time manipulation. In order to complete this application, I broke it into separate issues.

* Use moment.js to get the current date and time information
* Dynamically populate time blocks on the page upon page load
* Add functionality to check whether each time block was in the past, present, or future and set colors accordingly (updating every 7 minutes while page is open)
* Save task descriptions to localStorage when the save button is clicked for that task, so that saved tasks will persist when page is refreshed
